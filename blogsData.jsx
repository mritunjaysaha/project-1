                            Let's have a look at social media's adoption and how
                            it is evolving.

                            As mass media began to develop information could be
                            easily spread and by extension ideas. Ideas by their
                            very nature, good or bad, are disruptive to the
                            existing order. So governing entities have chosen to
                            regulate the flow of the same to keep their power
                            intact. This was implemented either through
                            carefully disguised regulations or outright
                            censorship for all of mass media. Besides,
                            monetisation options were limited. And therefore the
                            barrier of entry was high and only big media players
                            with parent companies/ government associations
                            survive in the market. So even though free speech is
                            ingrained in our laws, the reality is that no
                            sensible media house would risk their existence for
                            disruptive ideas making the mainstream media market
                            effectively an oligopoly.

                        <p>
                            Now during the early decades of 2010s, a wave of
                            social media platforms came up. These along with
                            improvements in recording tech (think smartphone
                            cameras) allowed anyone to become a media entity
                            without the high costs or regulatory laws.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Combine these with direct monetisation options and
                            we've got smaller creators creating more
                            personalized & niche content unheard of before.
                            Finally the attention economy was completely
                            democratized. Or was it? There's a small problem
                            with the above being that the platform was still
                            centrally owned. Now the governments can draw up
                            laws to regulate these platforms. Or in case of
                            immunity like section 230, platforms end up having
                            more soft power than regulators. They take up that
                            place with heavily regulated monetisation/
                            censorship to control the content.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This proves how centralization is going to
                            inevitably end up creating quasi fascistic entities
                            trying to rule us all. The solution lies in the
                            removal of the central entity by using decentralized
                            blockchains that allow for collective ownership by
                            the community. Any necessary regulations can be
                            built into the code/spread over community to
                            minimize biases associated with centralized
                            regulationThe absence of a central entity, makes the
                            system impervious to regulations/ takedowns from
                            authoritarian entities just like Bitcoin.
                            Monetisation through crypto economics is another way
                            of building up community engagement. It makes the
                            creators and curators partners in the growth of the
                            platform, similar to how employee stock options (
                            ESOPs) work.

                            posts. History does not directly repeat, although
                            the trends are often cyclical. Similar to the
                            analysis of social media above, through this blog I
                            would be exploring more specific case studies and
                            see if we can draw insights for future platforms/

                            As we discovered in the previous article, social
                            media succeeded because it brought personalization
                            to an industry. Early adopters found a digital
                            playground with the ability of making new
                            connections and creators able to create new forms of
                            content. Users were mostly left to themselves with
                            platform owners becoming pop culture icons. But as
                            these networks grow more and more big, they're
                            observed to get worse. Why is that so? Thanks to a
                            combination of market entry barriers and direct
                            network effects, they become virtual monopolies and
                            we stop seeing alternatives come up. As the novelty
                            factors faded and this became the usual, everyone
                            started to commoditize their accounts. Whilst this
                            indeed was great at creating new professions and
                            shouldn't have been a problem by itself, the
                            platform owners interfered tipped the scales shifted
                            in favor of money making over everything that made
                            the platform cool.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As a result, what we see today is a rat race of
                            chasing followers/subs,cancel culture mobs, and
                            propaganda amongst other things we saw with
                            mainstream media. All of these culminated in the
                            said platform losing that touch of personalization
                            with creators at the mercy of the platform
                            algorithms. In this crowded landscape of social
                            media monopolies, let's explore the rise of
                            Clubhouse and what can be its future?

                            Let’s see how it holds up against other social
                            media’s connections. What's the usual way of
                            connecting with people on social media? You DM/ put
                            a message request and wait for a reply and then take
                            the conversation forward, hopefully setting up a
                            call. So let's have a look at statistics for
                            response rates for different channels.

                        <p>
                            Numbers match up the statistics for voice. Approx 3
                            times jump in the response rates when voice is
                            involved even for cold calls. Sure it's harder to
                            get personal cell numbers &amp; no one is going to
                            appreciate spam calls these days. So through their
                            innovation of audio rooms clubhouse is able to find
                            a way to leverage the voice to take connections to a
                            different level. With Clubhouse we get to skip the
                            above hassles &amp; have the option of jumping in a
                            room with our target audience. With the right
                            targeting of rooms one can actually get in a direct
                            talk with the said person. Later on the conversation
                            can be followed up on other social media as a warm
                            outreach. Just like that you can convert cold leads(
                            strangers) into warm leads ( somewhat knowing them).

                        <p>
                            We can draw parallels with Google's search engine
                            interface being much cleaner and having faster
                            loading times than other browsers like Yahoo. Sure
                            there were a bunch of other factors but one must
                            remember that this was the early 2000s with slow
                            wireless internet connections with charges for every
                            GB of data being used.The above factor played a part
                            in retaining the users making them accustomed to the
                            browser.

                        <p>
                            One notable difference with their platform was that
                            it was invite only, with users having limited
                            invites(5). This may seem counter-intuitive to
                            growth but now the numbers show the opposite. In a
                            world where getting into social media networks was a
                            cakewalk, the invite only feature was able to
                            trigger the psychological need to be a part of the
                            cool crowd. Next as the platform was growing at an
                            early stage, the videos of clubhouse conversations
                            of celebrities went viral on the internet. This urge
                            to not be left out from what's happening combined
                            with the inbuilt feature of conversations having no
                            records triggered strong FOMOs among the crowd to be
                            not left behind similar to the people that start
                            rushing in after the first few have joined and
                            danced.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Another great example is the network of Apple
                            users.The value of the network is drawn not only
                            through the products but through their genius
                            branding campaigns. They are somehow able to build
                            the perception of Apple users being the cool crowd
                            and just like the video majority of users( after
                            early adopters) buy in to not be left out of the
                            movement. However if the crowd becomes too large
                            which it seems to be on the way, as clubhouse
                            spreads to new countries, the original adopters
                            would start leaving as the idea becomes too
                            mainstream. The challenge then is to make the
                            utility of the platform( like finding authentic
                            connections as above) outweigh the appeal of leaving
                            the crowd for greener pastures. Which factor would
                            end up winning on the long run would determine how
                            long would users remain on it.

                            However not everything is sunshine and roses with
                            this platform. With Clubhouse till now the
                            interference by the platform owners has been minimal
                            with no data storage &amp; room owners in charge of
                            the conversation with regulation left to them. But
                            we need to remember that these are the early days
                            and the focus is on growth. The best thing for
                            growth is to have a laissez faire approach( minimal
                            intervention). But as complaints of harassment built
                            up the pressure on them, they were forced to bring
                            out some regulations. Their solution for these
                            complaints has been to add a report feature that
                            will record the conversation and create an “internal
                            mechanism” to resolve the same. This is projected as
                            a necessary measure but the reality is that it's a
                            slippery slope to get started on.The app’s already
                            been banned in China and with many countries passing
                            laws for regulation of social media, it's a question
                            of how long would they be able to resist from heavy
                            handed regulation. As time passes with the flaws of
                            having a central authority and the observed pattern
                            of being regulated or becoming the centralized
                            regulator itself( aka twitter), it seems like
                            clubhouse could very well be on its way to becoming
                            what the social media giants today are.

                        <p>
                            So besides looking into integrating audio/video
                            rooms into Hive apps what can be possible lessons
                            from this? HIVE's utility and platform control has
                            never been a problem with the user-centric
                            features.and decentralized community regulation The
                            question then is how we can perfect on bandwagon
                            network effects. For the web 3.0, branding HIVE as
                            the new cool crowd can be a catalyst for bringing in
                            the vast majority of users similar to above examples
                            . Let's start a discussion in the comments on how we
                            are doing this and what strategies can we implement
                            for achieving that.

                        <p>
                            _One thing to be noted is that these laws came
                            through lobbying of entertainment conglomerates
                            notably Disney in the US to have copyrights last
                            forever for it's characters like Mickey Mouse. Some
                            of which are estimated to be worth hundreds of
                            millions today. This shows how the laws are designed
                            not with creators but rather the distributors in
                            mind
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            _The laws are so overly broad that they actually
                            stifle an individual’s creativity. Let's see how
                            it's so. With the emergence of YouTube new forms of
                            content like video essays, analysis and commentary
                            based on remixes or based on other original works.
                            And the terms of fair use are not very clear about
                            the same thereby keeping this sector in limbo
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            _These laws are hard to enforce in the digital
                            world. This is seen in the rampant nature of piracy.
                            Even outright bans/ website takedowns mean little as
                            emerging clones/ VPN amongst other methods render
                            the regulations ineffective
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            _And lastly these laws are so complicated and
                            unclear that they can be easily abused by companies
                            with access to lawyers. It’s too complicated and
                            expensive for individual artists/ creators to
                            actually enforce the rights that the law gives them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The above scenario heavily favours the massive
                            entertainment conglomerate and with the backing of
                            massive money leaving the creators/ production
                            studios which are relatively small with few choices
                            if any.Let's see how this affects us as customers
                            with a particular focus on video streaming services
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Using this massive advantage they vouch for
                            exclusivity arrangements on their streaming
                            services. The end result is a fragmented market with
                            consumers having to end up paying for multiple
                            streaming services. And with every new service
                            coming up with splitting libraries every other day
                            piracy has become the norm rather than the
                            exception.

                            So let's explore how decentralization can help us
                            break through yet another monopoly practice. The
                            best way to go about this would be tokenization of
                            the creative work using a decentralized blockchain
                            similar to how NFTs were made for artwork/
                            collectibles to establish ownership of the same.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Many parallels can be drawn with NFTs as in with
                            passing of ownership would ensure that the
                            artist/creators gets a cut of the deal everything
                            that happens. This has the potential for creators
                            making flexible arrangements/ smart contracts with
                            distributors. This has the potential for equalising
                            terms for both parties. This has potential for
                            democratization of this sector and allowing for
                            smaller players to emerge that work together with
                            creators rather than trying to rip them off. Similar
                            arrangements can be made for reworked/ remixed
                            content appropriate rules can be established for
                            usage and have the rewards shared with the original
                            source just like with NFT transfers transactions
                            benefiting the original artist
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Further copyright is based in legal systems of the
                            countries and often the large diversity and
                            complexity of laws means that the efforts for
                            expanding in newer regions is often not worth the
                            benefits (Reason why streaming services have
                            different catalogs across regions, or have
                            categories blocked across certain regions)
                            <br />
                            Tokenization can help us bypass this &amp; make the
                            creative content available all over the world and
                            expand the market multi-fold for creators making
                            their reach and support truly global. and lastly,
                            implementing anti-piracy measures would be way
                            easier. The blockchain system can be both used to
                            check for content ownership and help in
                            identification of the creator. Whilst this can't
                            completely eradicate piracy at least it can serve as
                            a better alternative to what we have for

                            It is important to note that Bitcoin is not just a
                            currency but also a decentralized peer to peer
                            transaction network with regulations built into the
                            code. For Bitcoin to be used effectively we need
                            both the end users to accept it for the transaction.
                            Therefore the usability increases with more users
                            getting the same. We can draw parallels with early
                            telephone systems being more useful with increased
                            customers. It is referred to as the direct network
                            effect. The true value of a network increases
                            exponentially as a factor of( 2^n) where n
                            represents the number of users. This is known as the
                            Reed's law for networks.{" "}

                            The network takes preference over the said product.
                            This allows for the product to stick around even
                            though they kinda suck. Most public utilities fall
                            in this category. The entry barrier lies in the
                            building of this network over everything. That's why
                            monopolies build around these things for real world

                            It's difficult to grow such a network even much so

                            with so many alternatives the market cap of Bitcoin
                            is still around 40% of the market.

                            approved of the bill legalizing Bitcoin as legal
                            tender. It represents a growing trend of acceptance
                            that no other cryptocurrency has achieved and the
                            legal acceptance would incentivize non enthusiasts
                            &amp; businesses to start transacting in that. This
                            would end up compounding the network effects

                            Bitcoin as a currency was meant to solve the problem
                            of removing the third party entity in transactions.
                            The rules were built into the code and the code only
                            alterable through the community. Only some minor
                            changes have been possible without the majority of
                            the code being not so different from its inception.
                            Above all most of these altcoins have third party

                            either for growth/ vaults) thus defeating the very
                            purpose of decentralization/ removal of third
                            parties.

                        <h4>Other factors</h4>
                        <p>
                            Whilst the code is pretty much untouchable in terms
                            of hard changes/ forks for a good reason there are
                            significant ways in which the infrastructure is
                            being improved on. One concern that has always been
                            with Bitcoin is the volatility. However, volatility
                            has reduced quite a lot( currently approx 10%)
                            compared to its early days if we ignore the phases
                            of bubble formation and crashes of a few months.
                            It's expected that volatility would be at levels of
                            stable fiats in a decade. Its here where we

                        <p>
                            Another method we could see the adoption increase is
                            in times of currency devaluations( hyperinflations)
                            which would incentivize customers to make the switch
                            to offset their losses. This is seen in regions of
                            Africa and Brazil. Also for the rest of the world
                            economic growth has been on shaky grounds and
                            unhealthy fiscal policies, so we could be seeing
                            more of such hyperinflation incidents in this
                            decade.

                            Plus there's proposals to start mining using
                            renewables reducing the carbon footprint and making.
                            These will help in making the mining process more
                            sustainable and bring in even bigger audiences

                        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                        <p>
                            In conclusion, any new alternatives planning to
                            replace Bitcoin will have an uphill battle against
                            the above factors amongst many others. Therefore for
                            the foreseeable future Bitcoin seems to be on the
                            path of being the primary cryptocurrency though an
                            argument can be made for the cryptos playing a
                            smaller, supporting role to it. Or maybe new
                            technological developments would end up changing the
                            same. What do you think on this?
