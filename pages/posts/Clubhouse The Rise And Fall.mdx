    As we discovered in the previous article, social media succeeded because it
    brought personalization to an industry. Early adopters found a digital
    playground with the ability of making new connections and creators able to
    create new forms of content. Users were mostly left to themselves with
    platform owners becoming pop culture icons. But as these networks grow more
    and more big, they're observed to get worse. Why is that so? Thanks to a
    combination of market entry barriers and direct network effects, they become
    virtual monopolies and we stop seeing alternatives come up. As the novelty
    factors faded and this became the usual, everyone started to commoditize
    their accounts. Whilst this indeed was great at creating new professions and
    shouldn't have been a problem by itself, the platform owners interfered
    tipped the scales shifted in favor of money making over everything that made
    the platform cool.
</p>

<p>
    As a result, what we see today is a rat race of chasing
    followers/subs,cancel culture mobs, and propaganda amongst other things we
    saw with mainstream media. All of these culminated in the said platform
    losing that touch of personalization with creators at the mercy of the
    platform algorithms. In this crowded landscape of social media monopolies,
    let's explore the rise of Clubhouse and what can be its future?
</p>

<h3>Simplifying connections</h3>

<p>
    Clubhouse promised to be a breath of fresh air in this landscape bringing in
    audio rooms to help you connect to new people. In the words of their founder
    Paul Davidson:

    Let’s see how it holds up against other social media’s connections. What's
    the usual way of connecting with people on social media? You DM/ put a
    message request and wait for a reply and then take the conversation forward,
    hopefully setting up a call. So let's have a look at statistics for response
    rates for different channels.
    <br />

<p>
    Numbers match up the statistics for voice. Approx 3 times jump in the
    response rates when voice is involved even for cold calls. Sure it's harder
    to get personal cell numbers &amp; no one is going to appreciate spam calls
    these days. So through their innovation of audio rooms clubhouse is able to
    find a way to leverage the voice to take connections to a different level.
    With Clubhouse we get to skip the above hassles &amp; have the option of
    jumping in a room with our target audience. With the right targeting of
    rooms one can actually get in a direct talk with the said person. Later on
    the conversation can be followed up on other social media as a warm
    outreach. Just like that you can convert cold leads( strangers) into warm
    leads ( somewhat knowing them).
</p>

<p>
    We can draw parallels with Google's search engine interface being much
    cleaner and having faster loading times than other browsers like Yahoo. Sure
    there were a bunch of other factors but one must remember that this was the
    early 2000s with slow wireless internet connections with charges for every
    GB of data being used.The above factor played a part in retaining the users
    making them accustomed to the browser.

<h3>Bandwagon network effects</h3>

    from Derek Silver about how movements start.
</p>

<p>
    One notable difference with their platform was that it was invite only, with
    users having limited invites(5). This may seem counter-intuitive to growth
    but now the numbers show the opposite. In a world where getting into social
    media networks was a cakewalk, the invite only feature was able to trigger
    the psychological need to be a part of the cool crowd. Next as the platform
    was growing at an early stage, the videos of clubhouse conversations of
    celebrities went viral on the internet. This urge to not be left out from
    what's happening combined with the inbuilt feature of conversations having
    no records triggered strong FOMOs among the crowd to be not left behind
    similar to the people that start rushing in after the first few have joined
    and danced.
</p>

<p>
    Another great example is the network of Apple users.The value of the network
    is drawn not only through the products but through their genius branding
    campaigns. They are somehow able to build the perception of Apple users
    being the cool crowd and just like the video majority of users( after early
    adopters) buy in to not be left out of the movement. However if the crowd
    becomes too large which it seems to be on the way, as clubhouse spreads to
    new countries, the original adopters would start leaving as the idea becomes
    too mainstream. The challenge then is to make the utility of the platform(
    like finding authentic connections as above) outweigh the appeal of leaving
    the crowd for greener pastures. Which factor would end up winning on the
    long run would determine how long would users remain on it.
</p>

<h3>Regulations and Uncertain future</h3>

<p>
    However not everything is sunshine and roses with this platform. With
    Clubhouse till now the interference by the platform owners has been minimal
    with no data storage &amp; room owners in charge of the conversation with
    regulation left to them. But we need to remember that these are the early
    days and the focus is on growth. The best thing for growth is to have a
    laissez faire approach( minimal intervention). But as complaints of
    harassment built up the pressure on them, they were forced to bring out some
    regulations. Their solution for these complaints has been to add a report
    feature that will record the conversation and create an “internal mechanism”
    to resolve the same. This is projected as a necessary measure but the
    reality is that it's a slippery slope to get started on.The app’s already
    been banned in China and with many countries passing laws for regulation of
    social media, it's a question of how long would they be able to resist from
    heavy handed regulation. As time passes with the flaws of having a central
    authority and the observed pattern of being regulated or becoming the
    centralized regulator itself( aka twitter), it seems like clubhouse could
    very well be on its way to becoming what the social media giants today are.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
    So besides looking into integrating audio/video rooms into Hive apps what
    can be possible lessons from this? HIVE's utility and platform control has
    never been a problem with the user-centric features.and decentralized
    community regulation The question then is how we can perfect on bandwagon
    network effects. For the web 3.0, branding HIVE as the new cool crowd can be
    a catalyst for bringing in the vast majority of users similar to above
    examples . Let's start a discussion in the comments on how we are doing this
    and what strategies can we implement for achieving that.
