    Copyright arrangements are kind of a legal monopoly for use of creative
    content. This is meant to incentivize artists with fair uses cases only
    allowed for non profit work. There has been an argument for these
    particularly with the creators, that its a protectionist measure to
    incentivize artists to keep making great content &amp; that if these
    measures are removed would lead to even more exploitation in a field
    dominated by corporate distributors. Let's look at their origins.

    _One thing to be noted is that these laws came through lobbying of
    entertainment conglomerates notably Disney in the US to have copyrights last
    forever for it's characters like Mickey Mouse. Some of which are estimated
    to be worth hundreds of millions today. This shows how the laws are designed
    not with creators but rather the distributors in mind
</p>
<p>
    _The laws are so overly broad that they actually stifle an individual’s
    creativity. Let's see how it's so. With the emergence of YouTube new forms
    of content like video essays, analysis and commentary based on remixes or
    based on other original works. And the terms of fair use are not very clear
    about the same thereby keeping this sector in limbo
</p>
<p>
    _These laws are hard to enforce in the digital world. This is seen in the
    rampant nature of piracy. Even outright bans/ website takedowns mean little
    as emerging clones/ VPN amongst other methods render the regulations
    ineffective
</p>
<p>
    _And lastly these laws are so complicated and unclear that they can be
    easily abused by companies with access to lawyers. It’s too complicated and
    expensive for individual artists/ creators to actually enforce the rights
    that the law gives them.
</p>
<p>
    The above scenario heavily favours the massive entertainment conglomerate
    and with the backing of massive money leaving the creators/ production
    studios which are relatively small with few choices if any.Let's see how
    this affects us as customers with a particular focus on video streaming
    services
</p>
<p>
    Using this massive advantage they vouch for exclusivity arrangements on
    their streaming services. The end result is a fragmented market with
    consumers having to end up paying for multiple streaming services. And with
    every new service coming up with splitting libraries every other day piracy
    has become the norm rather than the exception.

<h1>Disruption through tokenization</h1>

</p>
<p>
    So let's explore how decentralization can help us break through yet another
    monopoly practice. The best way to go about this would be tokenization of
    the creative work using a decentralized blockchain similar to how NFTs were
    made for artwork/ collectibles to establish ownership of the same.
</p>
<p>
    Many parallels can be drawn with NFTs as in with passing of ownership would
    ensure that the artist/creators gets a cut of the deal everything that
    happens. This has the potential for creators making flexible arrangements/
    smart contracts with distributors. This has the potential for equalising
    terms for both parties. This has potential for democratization of this
    sector and allowing for smaller players to emerge that work together with
    creators rather than trying to rip them off. Similar arrangements can be
    made for reworked/ remixed content appropriate rules can be established for
    usage and have the rewards shared with the original source just like with
    NFT transfers transactions benefiting the original artist
</p>
<p>
    Further copyright is based in legal systems of the countries and often the
    large diversity and complexity of laws means that the efforts for expanding
    in newer regions is often not worth the benefits (Reason why streaming
    services have different catalogs across regions, or have categories blocked
    across certain regions)
    <br />
    Tokenization can help us bypass this &amp; make the creative content
    available all over the world and expand the market multi-fold for creators
    making their reach and support truly global. and lastly, implementing
    anti-piracy measures would be way easier. The blockchain system can be both
    used to check for content ownership and help in identification of the
    creator. Whilst this can't completely eradicate piracy at least it can serve
    as a better alternative to what we have for verification
</p>
<p>
    In the next article we would be exploring how decentralization can help us
    build &amp; grow a better alternative for the video distribution platform
