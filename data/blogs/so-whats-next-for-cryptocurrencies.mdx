    So in the wake of the recent price crash, there's been a lot of hype going
    on about the end of Bitcoin and the emergence of better alternatives to the
    older cryptocurrencies. High volatility, high mining costs, energy
    requirements, the list goes on and on. To replace Bitcoin these cryptos

    It is important to note that Bitcoin is not just a currency but also a
    decentralized peer to peer transaction network with regulations built into
    the code. For Bitcoin to be used effectively we need both the end users to
    accept it for the transaction. Therefore the usability increases with more
    users getting the same. We can draw parallels with early telephone systems
    being more useful with increased customers. It is referred to as the direct
    network effect. The true value of a network increases exponentially as a
    factor of( 2^n) where n represents the number of users. This is known as the
    Reed's law for networks.{" "}

    The network takes preference over the said product. This allows for the
    product to stick around even though they kinda suck. Most public utilities
    fall in this category. The entry barrier lies in the building of this
    network over everything. That's why monopolies build around these things for
    real world equivalents
</p>
<p>
    It's difficult to grow such a network even much so in a decentralized
    manner, that's why even today with so many alternatives the market cap of
    Bitcoin is still around 40% of the market.
</p>
<p>
    Speaking of networks, El Salvador's legislature has approved of the bill
    legalizing Bitcoin as legal tender. It represents a growing trend of
    acceptance that no other cryptocurrency has achieved and the legal
    acceptance would incentivize non enthusiasts &amp; businesses to start
    transacting in that. This would end up compounding the network effects
    mentioned earlier.

<h5>Inadequate decentralization</h5>
<p>
    Speaking of these alternatives, let's have a look at alternatives being
    pitched for being the next big thing. First are CBDCs pitched by the central
    banks. For anyone with a basic understanding of inflationary policies used
    one can safely assume this is no better than fiat. And the switch from fiat
    to these(or by extension fiat backed cryptos) would be symbolic as the said
    crypto would be subject to secret devaluations.

    Bitcoin as a currency was meant to solve the problem of removing the third
    party entity in transactions. The rules were built into the code and the
    code only alterable through the community. Only some minor changes have been
    possible without the majority of the code being not so different from its
    inception. Above all most of these altcoins have third party centralized
    entities for many of the purposes( either for growth/ vaults) thus defeating
    the very purpose of decentralization/ removal of third parties.
</p>
<h4>Other factors</h4>
<p>
    Whilst the code is pretty much untouchable in terms of hard changes/ forks
    for a good reason there are significant ways in which the infrastructure is
    being improved on. One concern that has always been with Bitcoin is the
    volatility. However, volatility has reduced quite a lot( currently approx
    10%) compared to its early days if we ignore the phases of bubble formation
    and crashes of a few months. It's expected that volatility would be at
    levels of stable fiats in a decade. Its here where we
</p>
<p>
    Another method we could see the adoption increase is in times of currency
    devaluations( hyperinflations) which would incentivize customers to make the
    switch to offset their losses. This is seen in regions of Africa and Brazil.
    Also for the rest of the world economic growth has been on shaky grounds and
    unhealthy fiscal policies, so we could be seeing more of such hyperinflation
    incidents in this decade.

    Plus there's proposals to start mining using renewables reducing the carbon
    footprint and making. These will help in making the mining process more
    sustainable and bring in even bigger audiences

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>
    In conclusion, any new alternatives planning to replace Bitcoin will have an
    uphill battle against the above factors amongst many others. Therefore for
    the foreseeable future Bitcoin seems to be on the path of being the primary
    cryptocurrency though an argument can be made for the cryptos playing a
    smaller, supporting role to it. Or maybe new technological developments
    would end up changing the same. What do you think on this?
